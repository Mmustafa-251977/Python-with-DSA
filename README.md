# Python-with-DSA
Learning Python and mastering DSA through hands-on coding exercises, examples, and algorithm implementations.

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to learning Python programming language alongside Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It contains various coding exercises, examples, and implementations of common algorithms and data structures.

## Contents
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms (like quicksort, mergesort), searching algorithms (like binary search), and graph algorithms (like Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS).

- **Coding Exercises**: A collection of problems to practice Python programming and DSA concepts.
- **Examples**: Sample code snippets demonstrating the use of Python for various DSA concepts.
## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:
