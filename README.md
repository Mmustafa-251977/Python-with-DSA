# Python

A python is the high level programming language that is used for general purpose programming. It is an interpreted language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.  

# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science that deal with organizing and manipulating data efficiently. Data structures are used to store and organize data in a way that allows for efficient access and modification, while algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving specific problems or performing tasks. Together, DSA is essential for developing efficient and optimized software applications.

# Applications

# Python Installation & Setup
To install Python, follow these steps:
1. Download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing `python --version` or `python3 --version`.
4. Optionally, set up a virtual environment for your projects using `venv` or `virtualenv`.
5. Install any necessary packages using `pip`, Python's package manager.
6. Choose an IDE or text editor for writing your Python code, such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebooks.
