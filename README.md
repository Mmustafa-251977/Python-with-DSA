## Introduction - Basics of Python Programming
python is high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
### Key Features of Python
- Easy to Learn and Use
- Extensive Standard Library
- Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Strong Community Support
- Dynamic Typing
- Interpreted Language
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Versatile and Powerful
### Basic Syntax
- Indentation: Python uses indentation to define code blocks.
- Comments: Use `#` for single-line comments and `'''` or `"""` for multi-line comments.
- Variables: No need to declare variable types explicitly.
- Print Statement: Use `print()` to display output.
### Example Code
```python
# This is a simple Python program
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
greet("World")
```
### Getting Started
To start coding in Python, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download
it from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/). You can use any text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebook to write and run your Python code.
### Running Python Code
You can run Python code in several ways:
- Using the Python Interpreter: Open your terminal or command prompt and type `python` or `python3` to start the interactive shell.
- Running a Python Script: Save your code in a file with a `.py` extension and run it using the command `python filename.py` or `python3 filename.py`.
- Using an IDE: Write your code in an IDE and use the built-in run feature to execute your code.
### Next Steps
Once you have a basic understanding of Python syntax and features, you can start exploring data structures and
algorithms. This repository contains various examples and exercises to help you learn and practice DSA concepts using Python.
Feel free to explore the different sections and implement the algorithms and data structures provided here. Happy coding!
